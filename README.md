# Reader Mode

#### aka Every Motherfucking Website

This is a browser extension that removes every single bit of CSS from the current page, then replaces it with a stylesheet derived from the CSS found at http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com

## Usage

Clone the git repo, and install the unpacked extension.

## domains folder

There's very minimal support for adding per-domain styles. Create a `[domain with tld].css` file in the domain folder, and the extension will also load it - use it to remove extra trash that's not the main content.
